### Business objective  


Recent advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, alongside the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have ushered in a new era of capabilities in the digital domain. These technologies enable the intricate processing and interpretation of data, facilitating the creation of detailed, dynamic content that bridges the gap between textual concepts and visual storytelling. The integration of these technologies not only simplifies the translation of complex ideas into tangible visuals but also enhances creativity and efficiency in content generation. The goal of this task is to harness these capabilities to transform textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets into detailed storyboards. This transformation process aims to visually depict the narrative flow and user interaction within advertisements, making the conceptualization of digital campaigns both more intuitive and impactful.
